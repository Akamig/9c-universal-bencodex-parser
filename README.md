# 9c-universal-bencodex-parser?
This project is mainly focused on providing interface to generate, modify, interpret bencodex data used in lib9c in general. (action, state, etc)

- Provide basic example data for selected model. (AvatarState, StakeAction, Transactions, Etc)
- Make it real-time modifiable. (Edit interpreted data, and get modified bencodex immidiately, with added type check, I guess.)
- Get bencodex data from lib9c and guessing (or set manually) it's format.
